# Endee: High-Performance Open Source Vector Database

**Endee (nD)** is a specialized, high-performance vector database built for speed and efficiency. This guide covers supported platforms, dependency requirements, and detailed build instructions using both our automated installer and manual CMake configuration.

there are 3 ways to build and run endee:
1. quick installation and run using install.sh and run.sh scripts
2. manual build using cmake
3. using docker

also you can run endee using docker from docker hub without building it locally. refer to section 4 for more details.

## System Requirements

Before installing, ensure your system meets the following hardware and operating system requirements.

### Supported Operating Systems

* **Linux**: Ubuntu(22.04, 24.04, 25.04) Debian(12, 13), Rocky(8, 9, 10), Centos(8, 9, 10), Fedora(40, 42, 43)
* **macOS**: Apple Silicon (M Series) only.

### Required Dependencies

The following packages are required for compilation.

 `clang-19`, `cmake`, `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`

> **Note:** The build system requires **Clang 19** (or a compatible recent Clang version) supporting C++20.

---

## 1. Quick Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to build **ndd** is using the included `install.sh` script. This script handles OS detection, dependency checks, and configuration automatically.

### Usage

First, ensure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
```

Run the script from the root of the repository. You **must** provide arguments for the build mode and/or CPU optimization.

```bash
./install.sh [BUILD_MODE] [CPU_OPTIMIZATION]
```

### Build Arguments

You can combine one **Build Mode** and one **CPU Optimization** flag.

#### Build Modes

| Flag | Description | CMake Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--release` | **Default.** Optimized release build. |  |
| `--debug_all` | Enables full debugging symbols. | `-DND_DEBUG=ON -DDEBUG=ON` |
| `--debug_nd` | Enables NDD-specific logging/timing. | `-DND_DEBUG=ON` |

#### CPU Optimization Options

Select the flag matching your hardware to enable SIMD optimizations.

| Flag | Description | Target Hardware |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--avx2` | Enables AVX2 (FMA, F16C) | Modern x86_64 Intel/AMD |
| `--avx512` | Enables AVX512 (F, BW, VNNI, FP16) | Server-grade x86_64 (Xeon/Epyc) |
| `--neon` | Enables NEON (FP16, DotProd) | Apple Silicon / ARMv8.2+ |
| `--sve2` | Enables SVE2 (INT8/16, FP16) | ARMv9 / SVE2 compatible |

> **Note:** The `--avx512` build configuration enforces mandatory runtime checks for specific instruction sets. To successfully run this build, your CPU must support **`avx512` (Foundation), `avx512_fp16`, `avx512_vnni`, `avx512bw`, and `avx512_vpopcntdq`**; if any of these extensions are missing, the database will fail to initialize and exit immediately to avoid runtime crashes.


### Example Commands

**Build for Production (Intel/AMD with AVX2):**

```bash
./install.sh --release --avx2
```

**Example Build for Debugging (Apple Silicon):**

```bash
./install.sh --debug_all --neon
```

### Running the Server

We provide a `run.sh` script to simplify running the server. It automatically detects the built binary and uses `ndd_data_dir=./data` by default.

First, ensure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

Then run the script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This will automatically identify the latest binary and start the server.

#### Options

You can override the defaults using arguments:

*   `ndd_data_dir=DIR`: Set the data directory.
*   `binary_file=FILE`: Set the binary file to run.
*   `ndd_auth_token=TOKEN`: Set the authentication token (leave empty/ignore to run without authentication).

#### Examples

**Run with custom data directory:**

```bash
./run.sh ndd_data_dir=./my_data
```

**Run specific binary:**

```bash
./run.sh binary_file=./build/ndd-avx2
```

**Run with authentication token:**

```bash
./run.sh ndd_auth_token=your_token
```


**Run with all options**

```bash
./run.sh ndd_data_dir=./my_data binary_file=./build/ndd-avx2 ndd_auth_token=your_token
```

**For Help**

```bash
./run.sh --help
```


## 2. Manual Build (Advanced)

If you prefer to configure the build manually or integrate it into an existing install pipeline, you can use `cmake` directly.

### Step 1: Prepare Build Directory

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

### Step 2: Configure

Run `cmake` with the appropriate flags. You must manually define the compiler if it is not your system default.

**Configuration Flags:**

* **Debug Options:**
* `-DDEBUG=ON` (Enable debug symbols/O0)
* `-DND_DEBUG=ON` (Enable internal logging)


* **SIMD Selectors (Choose One):**
* `-DUSE_AVX2=ON`
* `-DUSE_AVX512=ON`
* `-DUSE_NEON=ON`
* `-DUSE_SVE2=ON`


**Example (x86_64 AVX512 Release):**

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DUSE_AVX512=ON \
      ..
```

### Step 3: Compile

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Running the Built Binary

After a successful build, the binary will be generated in the `build/` directory.

### Binary Naming

The output binary name depends on the SIMD flag used during compilation:

* `ndd-avx2`
* `ndd-avx512`
* `ndd-neon` (or `ndd-neon-darwin` for mac)
* `ndd-sve2`

A symlink called `ndd` links to the binary compiled for the current build.

### Runtime Environment Variables

Some environment variables **ndd** reads at runtime:

* `NDD_DATA_DIR`: Defines the data directory
* `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN`: Optional authentication token (see below)

### Authentication

**ndd** supports two authentication modes:

**Open Mode (No Authentication)** - Default when `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set:
```bash
# All APIs work without authentication
./build/ndd
curl http://{{BASE_URL}}/api/v1/index/list
```

**Token Mode** - When `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN` is set:
```bash
# Generate a secure token
export NDD_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
./build/ndd

# All protected APIs require the token in Authorization header
curl -H "Authorization: $NDD_AUTH_TOKEN" http://{{BASE_URL}}/api/v1/index/list
```

### Execution Example

To run the database using the AVX2 binary and a local `data` folder:

```bash
# 1. Create the data directory
mkdir -p ./data

# 2. Export the environment variable and run
export NDD_DATA_DIR=$(pwd)/data
./build/ndd
```

Alternatively, as a single line:

```bash
NDD_DATA_DIR=./data ./build/ndd
```

## 3. Docker Deployment

We provide a Dockerfile for easy containerization. This ensures a consistent runtime environment and simplifies the deployment process across various platforms.

### Build the Image

You **must** specify the target architecture (`avx2`, `avx512`, `neon`, `sve2`) using the `BUILD_ARCH` build argument. You can optionally enable a debug build using the `DEBUG` argument.

```bash
# Production Build (AVX2) (for x86_64 systems)
docker build --ulimit nofile=100000:100000 --build-arg BUILD_ARCH=avx2 -t endee-oss:latest -f ./infra/Dockerfile .

# Debug Build (Neon) (for arm64, mac apple silicon)
docker build --ulimit nofile=100000:100000 --build-arg BUILD_ARCH=neon --build-arg DEBUG=true -t endee-oss:latest -f ./infra/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Container

The container exposes port `8080` and stores data in `/data` inside container. You should persist this data using a docker volume.

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v endee-data:/data \
  -e NDD_AUTH_TOKEN="your_secure_token" \
  --name endee-server \
  endee-oss:latest
```

leave `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN` empty or remove it to run endee without authentication.

### Alternatively: Docker Compose

You can also use `docker-compose` to run the service.

1. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

---

## 4. Running Docker container from registry

You can run Endee directly using the pre-built image from Docker Hub without building locally.

### Using Docker Compose

Create a new directory for Endee:

```bash
mkdir endee && cd endee
```

Inside this directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and copy the following content into it:

```yaml
services:
  endee:
    image: endeeio/endee-server:latest
    container_name: endee-server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      NDD_NUM_THREADS: 0
      NDD_AUTH_TOKEN: ""  # Optional: set for authentication
    volumes:
      - endee-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  endee-data:
```

Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
